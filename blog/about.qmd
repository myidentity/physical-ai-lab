## The Mission

The Physical AI Laboratory aims to bridge the gap between digital intelligence and physical embodiment. We focus on:

- **High-Fidelity Simulation**: Leveraging NVIDIA Isaac Sim to create photorealistic training environments.
- **Sim-to-Real Transfer**: Robustifying policies for deployment on real hardware.
- **Open Science**: Documenting the "unsexy" parts of engineering—drivers, kernels, and dependency hell.
