## What You'll Learn

By the end of this guide, you will know:

- **Where to find** built-in robots and environments
- **How to load** robots into your simulation
- **How to download** additional assets from NVIDIA
- **How to import** your own robots (URDF/MJCF)

**Prerequisites:** Isaac Sim running ([see our setup guide](../2025-12-05-operationalizing-the-lab/index.qmd))
:::

---

## Before You Start

Make sure Isaac Sim is running. From your `physical-ai-lab` directory:

```bash
./auto_start.sh
# Select Option 1 (Start with GUI) or Option 2 (Start Headless)
```

To run Python scripts inside the container:

```bash
./python.sh your_script.py
```

See our [setup guide](../2025-12-05-operationalizing-the-lab/index.qmd) if you haven't installed Isaac Sim yet.

## 1. Understanding Asset Sources

When working with Isaac Sim, you have several options for finding robots, environments, and 3D objects.

### 1.1 Built-in Assets (In Container)

Located at `/isaac-sim/` inside the container. These are pre-installed with Isaac Sim and require no additional download.

**What's included:**

- Robots (Franka, Universal Robots, Carter, Jetbot)
- Environments (Warehouse, Hospital, Office)
- Props and objects

### 1.2 Asset Browser (Recommended Method)

The Asset Browser is NVIDIA's cloud-hosted asset library, accessible directly from Isaac Sim.

**How to access:**

```
Window → Browsers → Assets
```

::: {.callout-warning}
## Nucleus Deprecation Notice

Omniverse Nucleus is being deprecated (October 2025). The **Asset Browser** is now the recommended way to access NVIDIA assets. If you see references to Nucleus in older tutorials, use the Asset Browser instead.
:::

### 1.3 Isaac Lab Pre-configured Robots

Isaac Lab includes robots specifically configured for reinforcement learning:

- Pre-tuned physics parameters
- Sensors already configured
- Action spaces defined
- Ready for RL training

---

## 2. Built-in Robots

Here are the most commonly used robots included with Isaac Sim:

| Robot | Type | Use Case | Location |
|-------|------|----------|----------|
| **Franka Emika Panda** | Arm | Manipulation | `/Isaac/Robots/Franka/` |
| **Universal Robots (UR10)** | Arm | Industrial | `/Isaac/Robots/UniversalRobots/` |
| **Carter** | Mobile | Navigation | `/Isaac/Robots/Carter/` |
| **Jetbot** | Mobile | Education | `/Isaac/Robots/Jetbot/` |
| **ANYmal** | Quadruped | Locomotion | Isaac Lab |
| **Unitree Go1/Go2** | Quadruped | Locomotion | Isaac Lab |
| **Humanoid** | Bipedal | Walking | Isaac Lab |

### Loading a Robot via GUI

1. Open **Content Browser**: `Window → Browsers → Content`
2. Navigate to the robot folder (e.g., `/Isaac/Robots/Franka/`)
3. Drag the USD file to the viewport
4. Wait for loading (first time is slow due to shader compilation)

### Loading a Robot via Python

```python
from omni.isaac.core.utils.stage import add_reference_to_stage

# Load Franka robot
add_reference_to_stage(
    usd_path="/Isaac/Robots/Franka/franka_alt_fingers.usd",
    prim_path="/World/Franka"
)
```

::: {.callout-tip}
## What You Should See

The Franka robot arm appears in the viewport at the origin. The arm has 7 joints and gripper fingers.
:::

::: {.callout-note}
## First Load is Slow

The first time you load any asset, Isaac Sim compiles shaders. This can take 30-60 seconds. Subsequent loads are much faster.
:::

---

## 3. Built-in Environments

Isaac Sim includes several environments for testing:

| Environment | Description | Location |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **Simple Grid** | Basic testing ground | `/Isaac/Environments/Grid/` |
| **Warehouse** | Logistics/AMR testing | `/Isaac/Environments/Simple_Warehouse/` |
| **Hospital** | Healthcare robotics | `/Isaac/Environments/Hospital/` |
| **Office** | Indoor navigation | `/Isaac/Environments/Office/` |

### Loading an Environment

```python
from omni.isaac.core.utils.stage import add_reference_to_stage

# Load warehouse environment
add_reference_to_stage(
    usd_path="/Isaac/Environments/Simple_Warehouse/warehouse.usd",
    prim_path="/World/Warehouse"
)
```

::: {.callout-tip}
## What You Should See

A warehouse environment with shelves, pallets, and floor appears. Your robot will be placed at origin (0,0,0) inside the warehouse.
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
## Best Practice

Load environments before robots. This ensures the robot spawns on top of the ground plane correctly.
:::

---

## 4. Complete Working Example

Here's a complete Python script you can copy and run. This loads a Franka robot on a ground plane and runs the simulation.

```python
# complete_example.py
# Run with: ./python.sh complete_example.py

from omni.isaac.kit import SimulationApp
simulation_app = SimulationApp({"headless": False})

from omni.isaac.core import World
from omni.isaac.core.utils.stage import add_reference_to_stage

# Create simulation world
world = World()

# Add ground plane
world.scene.add_default_ground_plane()

# Load Franka robot
add_reference_to_stage(
    usd_path="/Isaac/Robots/Franka/franka_alt_fingers.usd",
    prim_path="/World/Franka"
)

# Reset and run simulation
world.reset()
print("Robot loaded! Press Ctrl+C to exit.")

while simulation_app.is_running():
    world.step(render=True)

simulation_app.close()
```

::: {.callout-tip}
## What You Should See

The Franka robot arm appears standing on a gray ground plane. The simulation runs continuously until you press Ctrl+C. First load takes 30-60 seconds for shader compilation.

## 5. Isaac Lab Robots {#sec-isaac-lab-robots}

Isaac Lab provides pre-configured robots optimized for reinforcement learning.

### Why Use Isaac Lab Robots?

- Physics parameters already tuned
- Sensors configured and working
- Action spaces defined for RL
- Tested and validated

### Available Robots

```bash
# List all available environments (includes robot info)
./isaaclab.sh -p scripts/environments/list_envs.py
```

### Example: Using Isaac Lab Robots

Isaac Lab robots are used within Isaac Lab training environments, not standalone scripts. Here's how the configuration looks:

```python
# This runs INSIDE an Isaac Lab training script
from omni.isaac.lab_assets.anymal import ANYMAL_D_CFG

# The robot config is passed to the environment
# See our setup guide for running complete Isaac Lab training
```

::: {.callout-note}
## Isaac Lab Context Required

Isaac Lab robots are designed to work within Isaac Lab training environments. See our [setup guide's training example](../2025-12-05-operationalizing-the-lab/index.qmd#sec-first-training) for how to run a complete Isaac Lab workflow with these robots.
:::

### Common Isaac Lab Robots

| Robot | Config Import | Use Case |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| ANYmal D | `from omni.isaac.lab_assets.anymal import ANYMAL_D_CFG` | Quadruped locomotion |
| Unitree Go1 | `from omni.isaac.lab_assets.unitree import UNITREE_GO1_CFG` | Quadruped locomotion |
| Franka | `from omni.isaac.lab_assets.franka import FRANKA_PANDA_CFG` | Manipulation |

---

## 6. Importing Custom Robots

If you have your own robot, you can import it from URDF or MJCF format.

### 6.1 URDF Import

URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) is the standard format for ROS robots.

```python
from omni.isaac.core.utils.extensions import enable_extension

# Enable URDF importer
enable_extension("omni.importer.urdf")

from omni.importer.urdf import _urdf

# Get URDF interface
urdf_interface = _urdf.acquire_urdf_interface()

# Configure import settings
import_config = _urdf.ImportConfig()
import_config.merge_fixed_joints = False
import_config.fix_base = True

# Import the robot
urdf_interface.parse_urdf(
    urdf_path="/path/to/your/robot.urdf",
    import_config=import_config
)
```

### 6.2 MJCF Import (MuJoCo)

MJCF is the native format for MuJoCo physics engine.

```python
from omni.isaac.core.utils.extensions import enable_extension

# Enable MJCF importer
enable_extension("omni.importer.mjcf")

# Similar process for MuJoCo XML files
```

::: {.callout-note}
## Asset Paths

For custom assets, we recommend storing them in `~/isaac-sim/data/` within your container. This keeps your custom assets organized and separate from built-in assets.
:::

---

## 7. Using the Asset Browser

The Asset Browser provides access to NVIDIA's cloud-hosted assets.

### Opening the Asset Browser

```
Window → Browsers → Assets
```

### What's Available

- Additional robots
- Detailed environments
- Props and objects
- Materials and textures

### Downloading Assets

1. Browse the catalog
2. Click on an asset to preview
3. Click "Download" or drag directly to viewport
4. Asset downloads to local cache

---

## 8. Quick Reference

| Task | How To |
|------|--------|
| Open Content Browser | `Window → Browsers → Content` |
| Open Asset Browser | `Window → Browsers → Assets` |
| Built-in robots | `/Isaac/Robots/` |
| Built-in environments | `/Isaac/Environments/` |
| Isaac Lab robots | `from omni.isaac.lab_assets import ...` |
| Import URDF | Enable `omni.importer.urdf` extension |
| Import MJCF | Enable `omni.importer.mjcf` extension |

---

## 9. Best Practices

### Loading Performance

- **First load is slow** - shader compilation takes time
- **Use cached assets** - subsequent loads are faster
- **Load environments first** - then add robots

### Asset Organization

- Keep custom assets in `~/isaac-sim/data/`
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Document asset sources for reproducibility

### Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Asset won't load | Check the file path is correct |
| Robot falls through floor | Load ground plane first |
| Very slow loading | First-time shader compilation, wait |
| Can't find asset | Check Content Browser path |
