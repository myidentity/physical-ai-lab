## Summary

**Go2-W = Wheeled variant of Go2** with 4 additional wheel motors (16 total joints vs 12).

While NVIDIA Isaac Sim does not include Go2-W in built-in assets, the **robot_lab** extension by fan-ziqi provides ready-to-use RL training environments.

---

## Quick Start: Training Go2-W

```bash
# Clone robot_lab extension
git clone https://github.com/fan-ziqi/robot_lab.git
python -m pip install -e source/robot_lab

# Train Go2-W locomotion
python scripts/reinforcement_learning/rsl_rl/train.py \
  --task=RobotLab-Isaac-Velocity-Rough-Unitree-Go2W-v0 --headless

# Play trained policy
python scripts/reinforcement_learning/rsl_rl/play.py \
  --task=RobotLab-Isaac-Velocity-Rough-Unitree-Go2W-v0
```

**Compatibility**: Isaac Sim 4.5/5.0/5.1 + Isaac Lab 2.3.0

## Go2-W Specifications

| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| Total Joints | 16 (12 leg + 4 wheel motors) |
| Tires | 7-inch pneumatic |
| Max Wheeled Speed | 2.5 m/s |
| Weight | ~18 kg |
| Max Climb Angle | 35 degrees |
| Obstacle Height | Up to 70cm (walking mode) |

**Key Feature:** Wheel motors can be locked programmatically for static maneuvers (stair climbing).

## Custom USD Import Workflow

If robot_lab doesn't fit your needs, import URDF manually:

1. Get URDF from `unitree_ros/robots/go2w_description/`
2. In Isaac Sim: `Isaac Utils > Workflows > URDF Importer`
3. Configure wheel joints as **velocity mode**
4. Set appropriate collision filtering
5. Save USD for reuse

## Comparison: Go2 vs Go2-W

| Feature | Go2 | Go2-W |
|---------|-----|-------|
| Joint Count | 12 | 16 |
| Wheels | No | Yes (4) |
| Max Speed | ~3.5 m/s (running) | ~2.5 m/s (wheeled) |
| Isaac Lab Built-in | ✅ | ❌ |
| robot_lab Extension | N/A | ✅ |
| Locomotion Type | Legged only | Hybrid wheel-leg |

## Questions About Go2-W
1. Any plans to add Go2-W to Isaac Lab official assets?
2. Best practices for hybrid wheel-leg reward design?
3. How to handle wheel lock/unlock in RL training?
4. Sim-to-real considerations for wheeled-legged robots?
