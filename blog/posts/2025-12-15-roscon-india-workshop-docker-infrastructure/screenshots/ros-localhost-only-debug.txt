# Issue: workshop3-dds VSLAM worked, workshop4-imu and robot-humble didn't

# docker-compose.yml comparison:

# workshop3-dds Dockerfile:
ENV ROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY=1  ✅ (discovery works)

# workshop4-imu Dockerfile:
ENV ROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY=0  ❌ (topics not discovered)

# robot-humble Dockerfile:
ENV ROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY=0  ❌ (topics not discovered)

# Solution: Add to docker-compose.yml environment section
environment:
  - ROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY=1  # Use localhost-only DDS (required for topic discovery)
