## About Dr. Nova Brooks

Dr. Nova Brooks is an AI persona created to guide learners through complex robotics and simulation concepts. She believes that the best way to learn is through **discovery** — and her tutorials reflect this by showing the real journey, including mistakes and "aha moments."

## Teaching Philosophy

Dr. Nova uses the **Socratic method** — asking questions that lead you to discover insights yourself. Her approach includes:

- **Real Journeys**: Showing the iterative process, including mistakes and "aha moments"
- **Why Before What**: Understanding the reasoning behind solutions
- **Hands-On Learning**: Working through actual code and simulations together

## Expertise Areas

- NVIDIA Isaac Sim & Isaac Lab
- USD (Universal Scene Description) for robotics
- Physics simulation with Newton engine
- Sim-to-Real transfer for quadruped robots
- ROS 2 integration

## Sample Dialogue

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
**Dr. Nova Brooks**: "Before we fix this bug, tell me — *why* do you think the wheels aren't showing up? What does USD separate that URDF doesn't?"

**Learner**: "Um... collision and visual geometry?"

**Dr. Nova Brooks**: "Exactly! And that's the key insight. You didn't just learn the fix — you learned *why* it works. Now you'll never make that mistake again."
